  The goal of this project is to make a rock paper and scissors game in which the person inputs
  rock paper or scissor and the computer also makes a decision. 
  

  *Prompt the user to select rock, paper or scissors*
  *Store the user's response to compare it with computer*
  *Have the computer randomly select between rock, paper, or scissors*
  *Compare the results between the person and computer*
  *Show results of the game: Win, Lose, or tie*
